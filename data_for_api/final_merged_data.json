No more than one credit in\nCOMPSCI 870\nmay be used to meet the requirements. All courses must be approved in the Program of Study. Any non-CompSci courses must be approved prior to registration.\nIndustrial Internship\nWith faculty advisor’s approval, one credit per semester of\nCOMPSCI 999\nmay be satisfied with a supervised industrial internship for a maximum of three credits.\nAdditional Requirements\nMajor Professor as Advisor\nThe student is assigned an initial faculty advisor at the time of admission. The student selects a faculty member as a thesis or capstone advisor, respectively, as they follow the regular or professional track, after consultation with that faculty member. Any change in faculty advisor requires the documented permission of the new faculty member and the Department. An initial Program of Study with student, advisor and Department approval should be completed prior to the completion of 9 credits in the program. The final Program of Study must be approved by the thesis or capstone advisor, as appropriate.\nSwitching between Tracks\nA student in the regular track may switch to the professional track at any time. However, such a student will no longer be eligible for research/teaching/project assistantships or any other financial aid from the Computer Science department. A student switching to the professional track may need to take the equivalent of\nCOMPSCI 351\n. A student admitted under the professional track may switch to the regular track after completing at least 9 credits of 700-level CompSci courses or\nCOMPST 751\nwith at least 3.5 cumulative GPA. Note that not all courses acceptable under the professional track may be acceptable under the regular track.\nFinancial Aid\nStudents enrolled in the professional track are not eligible for financial aid from the Computer Science department including research assistantships, teaching assistantships, project assistantships, fellowships and/or tuition waivers. However, such students are still eligible for financial aid available elsewhere on the campus.\nTime Limit\nAll students must complete the degree requirements within five years of initial enrollment.",

Both components should address the following concerns (as described by the rubric form completed by faculty when assessing Capstone projects).\nThe report and presentation should demonstrate understanding of the broad problem being addressed, as it pertains to the “real world.”\nIt should specify: the target user, the type of task that it supports, the reason the user needs to perform this task, the main limitations to the approach currently used in practice, and what problems those limitations might cause. They should also describe the significance of the work, such as how important this task is to the target business and how large or critical this business is to society or to the economy. If there are other systems that exist that solve the same problem, mention a few of them and why the company chose not to use them if they were available at the time. (If you do not know why it is okay to mention them but indicate that the reasons for pursuing a new solution were not shared with you by the company.)\nThe report and presentation should demonstrate understanding of the solution at a technical level,\nincluding links to access any code that was written or, if cloud/commercial software or services were used, the report should include pseudocode for key algorithms. Also, for any tools that were used, the report should assess the relevant capabilities and limitations of each of the tools that you combined in the workflow. An overview, including an architecture diagram, should also be included in the presentation.\nThe report and presentation should include a description of the methods for systematic testing or validation and the findings of the testing, providing quantitative metrics to the extent possible.\nFor qualitative measures, you might survey a sample of the actual users of the system; for example, you could ask:\nto what extent they feel the solution addressed the target problem,\nwhat they consider to be the primary strengths of the solution,\nwhat they consider to be the primary limitations of the solution and whether they think it would be worthwhile to address those limitations in the near term.",

For people with a MS in electrical engineering, computer applications, information science, or information technology, we recommend a second MS in CS before applying to the doctoral program. These related fields are not close enough to core computer science to give a strong foundation for doctoral studies. Additionally, a maximum of 33 credits may be considered for transfer credits into the PhD from an earned MS degree."
