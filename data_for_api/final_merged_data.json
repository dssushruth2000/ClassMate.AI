No more than one credit in\nCOMPSCI 870\nmay be used to meet the requirements. All courses must be approved in the Program of Study. Any non-CompSci courses must be approved prior to registration.\nIndustrial Internship\nWith faculty advisor’s approval, one credit per semester of\nCOMPSCI 999\nmay be satisfied with a supervised industrial internship for a maximum of three credits.\nAdditional Requirements\nMajor Professor as Advisor\nThe student is assigned an initial faculty advisor at the time of admission. The student selects a faculty member as a thesis or capstone advisor, respectively, as they follow the regular or professional track, after consultation with that faculty member. Any change in faculty advisor requires the documented permission of the new faculty member and the Department. An initial Program of Study with student, advisor and Department approval should be completed prior to the completion of 9 credits in the program. The final Program of Study must be approved by the thesis or capstone advisor, as appropriate.\nSwitching between Tracks\nA student in the regular track may switch to the professional track at any time. However, such a student will no longer be eligible for research/teaching/project assistantships or any other financial aid from the Computer Science department. A student switching to the professional track may need to take the equivalent of\nCOMPSCI 351\n. A student admitted under the professional track may switch to the regular track after completing at least 9 credits of 700-level CompSci courses or\nCOMPST 751\nwith at least 3.5 cumulative GPA. Note that not all courses acceptable under the professional track may be acceptable under the regular track.\nFinancial Aid\nStudents enrolled in the professional track are not eligible for financial aid from the Computer Science department including research assistantships, teaching assistantships, project assistantships, fellowships and/or tuition waivers. However, such students are still eligible for financial aid available elsewhere on the campus.\nTime Limit\nAll students must complete the degree requirements within five years of initial enrollment.",

Both components should address the following concerns (as described by the rubric form completed by faculty when assessing Capstone projects).\nThe report and presentation should demonstrate understanding of the broad problem being addressed, as it pertains to the “real world.”\nIt should specify: the target user, the type of task that it supports, the reason the user needs to perform this task, the main limitations to the approach currently used in practice, and what problems those limitations might cause. They should also describe the significance of the work, such as how important this task is to the target business and how large or critical this business is to society or to the economy. If there are other systems that exist that solve the same problem, mention a few of them and why the company chose not to use them if they were available at the time. (If you do not know why it is okay to mention them but indicate that the reasons for pursuing a new solution were not shared with you by the company.)\nThe report and presentation should demonstrate understanding of the solution at a technical level,\nincluding links to access any code that was written or, if cloud/commercial software or services were used, the report should include pseudocode for key algorithms. Also, for any tools that were used, the report should assess the relevant capabilities and limitations of each of the tools that you combined in the workflow. An overview, including an architecture diagram, should also be included in the presentation.\nThe report and presentation should include a description of the methods for systematic testing or validation and the findings of the testing, providing quantitative metrics to the extent possible.\nFor qualitative measures, you might survey a sample of the actual users of the system; for example, you could ask:\nto what extent they feel the solution addressed the target problem,\nwhat they consider to be the primary strengths of the solution,\nwhat they consider to be the primary limitations of the solution and whether they think it would be worthwhile to address those limitations in the near term.",

                "You should have successfully completed two courses in programming, or gained equivalent experience through self-study or in employment (please describe in your reason statement). You may be required to take remedial programming courses unless you place out of them using our placement examinations, which can be taken only once.",
                "You should have completed a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or in Computer Engineering (if it has a strong Computer Science core) with an excellent overall evaluation from a respected university."

            "5. Can I overcome a bad undergraduate GPA?": [
                "If your undergraduate GPA is above 2.50 (but below 3.0), you may beconsideredfor admission on probation by presenting evidence of ability to succeed in graduate-level work. Applicants with GPA of 2.50-2.74 must present at leastoneof the following:",

            ],
            "6. Do you offer evening and online courses?": [
                "Most in-person CS graduate courses are taught in the late afternoon or evening. Some are even taught over the lunch hour. The MS regular track (thesis) program is currently not fully online. But, a number of our courses are offered in “blended” format with fewer in-person class meetings (e.g. 8 or 10 total) and with much of the instruction being provided online.",
                "The Professional MS track is available online, in person or a combination of both; you make the choice."
            ],
            "7. When will I know whether I have been admitted?": [
                "After all application materials are submitted your application is evaluated by the Graduate School and then released to the College of Engineering & Applied Science Graduate Programs Office. CS applications are evaluated by an admission committee. This process usually takes two months.  We anticipate rendering a decision on all applications submitted by the March 15thdeadline before June 1st."
            ],
            "8. Should I apply for the PhD or the MS?": [
                "The CS department rarely admits directly to the PhD without an MS in Computer Science. For people with a MS in electrical engineering, computer applications, information science, or information technology, we recommend a second MS in CS before applying to the doctoral program. These related fields are not close enough to core computer science to give a strong foundation for doctoral studies. Additionally, a maximum of 33 credits may be considered for transfer credits into the PhD from an earned MS degree."
            ],
            "9. Can I change the degree to which I’m applying?": [
                "If you originally applied to a different program you may request the Graduate Programs Office to forward your application to the Computer Science department for review via e-mail. The same applies to people who applied to the PhD and wish to be considered for the MS program, or to be switched to your desired tracks."
            ],
            "10. Can I switch between tracks after being admitted?": [
                "A student admitted under the professional track may switch to the regular track after completing at least nine credits of advanced courses (CompSci 700-level or CompSci 751) in the professional track with at least a 3.5 cumulative GPA. Note that not all courses acceptable under the professional track may be acceptable under the regular track.",
                "A student in the regular track may apply to switch to the professional track at any time; approval of the department will be granted, unless one has previously received a tuition waiver as a TA/RA."
            ],
            "11. Can I ask for reconsideration if denied admission?": [
                "Within a year you may ask for reconsideration of a negative decision, especially if the circumstances of your original application have changed."

            "12. Can I defer admission?": [
                "Students may defer admission up to two semesters without completing a new application. If a student would like to defer, e-mail the College of Engineering & Applied Science Graduate Programs office at:ceas-cs@uwm.edu (mailto:ceas-cs@uwm.edu)"

            "13. What support/employment can I get?": [
                "Students in the Professional Track are not eligible for departmental support or scholarships (including fee waivers).  Students on an F-1 visa may work up to 50% time in on-campus employment which ranges $10-15/hour (Seehttps://pantherjobs.uwm.edu).  There is also the possibility of “Curricular practical training” after successful completion of two semesters in the program.
